  		<h1>Resident to Resident Violence in Nursing Homes</h1>
  		<h2>Understaffing and Undertraining Remain A Continuing Problem</h2>

			Edward Flynn, 87, was a devoted husband and father.  A lifelong car salesman, he spent 41 years selling GMC and Volvo trucks.  In the final five years of his life, he was a resident of Apple Rehab nursing home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  His only daughter and caregiver, Lee-Ann Flynn, would visit him regularly - sometimes multiple times a day to make sure he was being cared for properly.

			<p>	Stephen Luckett, 70, was also a patient at Apple Rehab. For several days, the two men had been arguing over Flynn’s television volume being too high.  On June 4, 2022, the argument spiraled out of control when Luckett pushed Flynn down, causing him to fall backwards. As he fell, Flynn hit his neck on a door frame.
			</p>

			<p>
			Flynn was taken to a local hospital with severe enough injuries, including a fractured neck, that he had to immediately be transferred to Yale New Haven Trauma Center for emergency spinal fusion surgery.  He died two weeks later from complications.  After an investigation, the Department of Public Health found that Apple Rehab failed to keep Flynn safe - committing something that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) calls Immediate Jeopardy.

			<p>The medical examiner ruled Flynn's death a homicide.  Luckett was charged with one felony and four misdemeanors: second degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, assault, assault of the elderly and criminal negligence. Flynn’s daughter sued Apple Rehab nursing home and recently settled out of court.  The case is sealed.
			 </p>

			<p>“This is just such a horrible, vivid memory that my father passed due to the negligence of Apple Rehab,” said Flynn.

			<h2>These cases of aggression in nursing homes are not isolated.</h2>


				<p>
				 Researchers estimate about 5 percent of residents in America’s nursing homes and memory care facilities have faced resident to resident physical violence. These include physical injuries, sexual and verbal abuse - sometimes leading to death.

				</p>

				<p>In an investigation spanning 20 states, the NYCity News Service revealed incidents that impacted at least 523 victims and at least 334 perpetrators since January 2019. These incidents include physical and sexual violence, with consequences as severe as rape or even death. Of at least 220 facilities with incidents, 187 are for profit. The remaining 33 facilities are either non-profit or government run.
				</p>


				<p>
				Aggression and violence in long term care facilities occur for a variety of reasons such as insufficient staff to patient ratio, lack of enforcement of specific resident care plans, and state and federal agencies that are critically understaffed.

				</p>

			<h2>Experts are in agreement that understaffing of nursing homes is at the heart of the problem.  </h2>
			<p>

				According to Tony Chicotel, Senior Staff Attorney of <a href="https://canhr.org/"> California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform (CANHR) </a> </figcaption>, the regulatory environment of nursing homes is robust, but difficult to enforce. California has implemented solutions which could be lifesaving elsewhere, but they are sure to face political challenges along the way especially with the re-elected Trump/Musk administration coming into office in January 2025.

			</p>

			<p>Chicotel believes that it's all about enforcement in nursing homes.  "It's understaffing.  Understaffing is the root of all evil. With enforcement, 	that's sort of the root of all government evil. There's just not enough enforcement."
			</p>



			<h2>The future of nursing home care - training and oversight.</h2>

			<p>
				Rhoda Meador, Associate Director of the Cornell Institute for Translational Research on Aging, is a firm believer in development of training manuals to prevent resident to resident aggression in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Meador has seen its benefits.

			</p>

			<p>
				In a long term study, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23159018/"> Staff Intervention Targeting Resident-to-Resident Elder Mistreatment, </a> </figcaption> Meador studied 405 residents from 47 nursing home units in New York City and New York State.  The objective was to evaluate the impact of a newly developed training intervention for nursing staff on knowledge, recognition and reporting of resident to resident aggression.  The conclusions of the study revealed that training intervention is effective in enhancing knowledge and making sure staff reports these indcidents.
			</p>

			<p>

				Meador, after working with facilities, created free online manuals and online courses to make it easier for the staff to get this training.

			</p>

			<p>"It's almost impossible to get these facilities and communities to do the training or deliver the training because they are so overwhelmed with staffing shortages, that many of them operate in a crisis mode," says Meador.
